The whole of Spectre looks tired<BREAK>. From its ageing star Daniel Craig<BREAK>, who famously remarked that he would rather slash his wrists than make another Bond movie to the script<BREAK>, direction and stunts<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> It appears that Craig's apathy has infected everyone who worked on the production<BREAK>, that no one made an effort<BREAK>, that they were all just glad to be finished regardless of the quality of the final product<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> Is it a sign of laziness that the film cast Lea Seydoux from Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol<BREAK>? possibly<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> Does SPECTRE contain the most tedious uninvolving car chase ever filmed<BREAK>? undoubtedly<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> Towards the end of the movie<BREAK>, where Bond dispatches enemy guards who stand around waiting to be killed<BREAK>, it is almost impossible to suppress a groan of horror that the Bond franchise has sunk to such depths<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> Daniel Craihg says that he would rather slash his wrists than star in another Bond movie<BREAK>? I'd rather slash my wrists than watch one<BREAK>.<BREAK>
I'm a huge fan of the Piates of the Caribbean movies<BREAK>, but I was a little nervous about seeing this third installment because of the not as good other third installments<BREAK>. I still had pretty high expectations<BREAK>, and I was not disappointed<BREAK>! The plot was brilliant and very creative<BREAK>, with plenty of exciting twists and turns<BREAK>. As always<BREAK>, the acting was incredible<BREAK>. Johnny Depp always does an amazing job<BREAK>, but his Captain Jack Sparrow is probably one of his bests works yet<BREAK>! I still don't see how anyone could be so brilliant<BREAK>.<BREAK>.<BREAK>. Anyways<BREAK>, overall<BREAK>, just a really great film<BREAK>. Better than the other Pirate films in the trilogy (<BREAK>and you know how good those are<BREAK>!<BREAK>) See it<BREAK>, you won't be disappointed<BREAK>!<BREAK>
No spoiler review: <NEWLINE> As a Bond fan this was a really poor showing<BREAK>. I have enjoyed Daniel for the most part in each film<BREAK>. However<BREAK>, this one felted weighted and boring<BREAK>. I went and saw it opening night looking forward to something close to Skyfall or at least Quantum of Solace<BREAK>. Instead I think it would have been better renting it<BREAK>. It was slow<BREAK>, the enemies seemed almost confused on what they were doing and overall the story felt forced<BREAK>. After seeing this film I see why Daniel was saying he didn't want to do another<BREAK>. This director I think might be getting bored<BREAK>, as he shot far to many artistic panoramas like it is a Western and arty Bond angles which simply were not needed<BREAK>. I hope Daniel does anther but they have a different writer and director<BREAK>.<BREAK>
I liked the new Toy Story 3 fairly well although it's not quite up to par to many of the newer Pixar releases<BREAK>, and not as involving as the original Toy Story or as entertaining as the Toy Story 2<BREAK>. I'd rank it a little behind "Up" in terms of entertainment<BREAK>. It was a fun outing worth catching in the theater<BREAK>. Most (<BREAK>if not all<BREAK>) the original voice actors are back in action and do a satisfactory job of voice work<BREAK>. The underlying story is somewhat slow moving at times while there are a couple standout funny parts<BREAK>, and a good beginning and touching ending<BREAK>. I think it's about time to put this particular movie series to bed although it's original predecessor helped usher in the era for Pixar Movies for which I always have quite high expectations<BREAK>.<BREAK>
Sunday afternoon<BREAK>, nothing to do and awful weather<BREAK>.<BREAK>. I was looking for an action movie which could take my mind off that boring day and I rented "15 minutes"<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> I was seriously disappointed<BREAK>. I watched a few movies as bad as this one and I thought it was going to be much better because of Robert De Niro<BREAK>.<BREAK>. I was wrong<BREAK>! There's no action (<BREAK>or at least not good action<BREAK>)<BREAK>, far too much violence and the continuous subtitle from Russian are distracting<BREAK>. The plot is not very good and the fact that a fireman could work side by side with a policeman is not explained well enough<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> One more bad side<BREAK>, the audio is very bad<BREAK>. You can't understand anything they say when they are on the street of where there's a bit of action/shooting<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> DO NOT watch this movie<BREAK>!<BREAK>!<BREAK>
This is the worst Bond movie ever<BREAK>, filled with emotionless characters that I couldn't care less about<BREAK>. The pace of this film after a predictably exciting start is slow and boring<BREAK>. Unlike his fellow actors<BREAK>, Ben Whishaw as Q manages to portray the only believable human in this whole fake production<BREAK>. Why couldn't JB have been given a touch of Q's wit<BREAK>, humour or vulnerability<BREAK>? No wonder Daniel Craig wants out of this franchise - it's beneath his talent<BREAK>. Such a cacophony of totally forgettable dialogue<BREAK>, people and silly stunts is hard to imagine in a single movie and yet here it is<BREAK>. During one of the 'action' fights when James was being hammered by the evil assassin I noticed the person next to me had fallen asleep and was snoring<BREAK>. That person was an exceedingly eloquent critic<BREAK>.<BREAK>
Going into this movie I had one wish: To leave feeling that it was a successful conclusion to a two-part film<BREAK>. Taking Reloaded/Revolutions as a single (<BREAK>very large<BREAK>) movie with an intermission is the best way to evaluate it<BREAK>. Viewed that way I think it succeeded<BREAK>. I thought Revolutions was the equal of Reloaded<BREAK>, yet I can see how many will think it failed<BREAK>. The ending gave us everything we needed to know<BREAK>, but did not show us all we wanted to see<BREAK>. I'm speaking of the last twenty minutes or so here<BREAK>. After a visually robust middle<BREAK>, in which I felt my eyes grow larger in their sockets more than once<BREAK>, the ending seemed like an anticlimax<BREAK>. It needed to be longer<BREAK>, and I would gladly have traded some of the fx flair used earlier to give the final part of the film it's justified due<BREAK>. It will be awhile before I can look at it more objectively (<BREAK>perhaps I'll have to wait to view the two parts as one on DVD<BREAK>)<BREAK>. I only suggest now that anyone seeing it let it sink in completely before being too critical<BREAK>.<BREAK>
If you want to see a painfully unoriginal and unengaging story of paint-by-number characters getting at it in the green room for 90% of the time<BREAK>, go see this movie<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> The most deplorable thing about this movie - aside from the plot being an incoherent mess - is the way the villains are portrayed as caricatures<BREAK>, and the good guys as saints who can do no wrong<BREAK>. I don't know about you<BREAK>, but when the villains are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths with no real motive or character<BREAK>, I lose interest in the story<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> tl;dr lots of CG<BREAK>, completely two-dimensional characters and a plot that could've been auto-generated with a smartphone app<BREAK>.<BREAK>
This movie has one of Will Smith's best performances with the right emotions and never ruining a moment with inappropriate comedy<BREAK>. The whole film is a good balance of drama<BREAK>, suspense and action<BREAK>, not to mention terror<BREAK>. The film can be heartbreaking at times<BREAK>, to the point I myself was drawn to tears<BREAK>. I can't say much about this movie without spoiling it for those who may have not seen it<BREAK>, but the score by James newton Howard is saddening and one of his best<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> The atmosphere is full of a silent tension<BREAK>. Despite it's short length<BREAK>, the film is an escapade that must be seen to be believed<BREAK>. Over all great film and I definitely recommend it<BREAK>.<BREAK>
I gave it 4 stars only because I'm rounding up from the 3<BREAK>.<BREAK>5 it probably deserves<BREAK>. The first hour and a quarter the movie was cheesy and with horrible lines (<BREAK>"you nicknamed my daughter after the loch Ness monster<BREAK>?<BREAK>) but in my opinion the acting was at least better than the rest<BREAK>. The CGI of the baby and little girl was so horrible I was actually embarrassed for the actors in the scenes who couldn't have known during shooting how silly they would look interacting with it<BREAK>. It was simply awful<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> Now<BREAK>, what saves the movie is the last 20 minutes<BREAK>. I thought it was an incredible twist only truly able to be appreciated by readers of the books<BREAK>. I bet it made Stephanie Meyer wish she wrote it that way<BREAK>. It was fun to experience the audiences astonishment as events unfolded<BREAK>.<BREAK>.<BREAK>. And to be honest<BREAK>, I wrestled with my own unexpected feelings as I watched it<BREAK>. In the end though<BREAK>, those last 20 minutes and the great performance (<BREAK>as usual<BREAK>) by Michael Sheen saved the movie from being a wasted night<BREAK>. In fact<BREAK>, the last 20 minutes alone ALMOST makes me want to see it again<BREAK>.<BREAK>
When i heard people calling this movie the "best comicbook movie ever" and "Masterpiece" i should have known that was fanboy hype<BREAK>.<BREAK>So when i went to the movie theater i was expecting to be blown away<BREAK>.<BREAK>The movie can be best described as solid but nothing that special<BREAK>.<BREAK>Robert Downey Jnr basically holds this movie together<BREAK>,<BREAK>without him it could have been a disaster<BREAK>.<BREAK>But the movie was quite enjoyable and given what Marvel have given us the past few years this was one of their better offerings<BREAK>,<BREAK>kudos Mr Favreau<BREAK>.<BREAK>Overall this movie was a 7/10 and i still feel that Batman Begins is the benchmark for style<BREAK>,<BREAK>depth and tone of comicbook movies<BREAK>,<BREAK>sadly this does not surpass it<BREAK>.<BREAK>
Lets be frank<BREAK>. If you had a dime for every time Hollywood took something dusty and old<BREAK>, and tried to turn it into something shiny and new<BREAK>, you could retire<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> In fact<BREAK>, most of these attempts barely work<BREAK>. But (<BREAK>having seen this one front to back three times since its first release<BREAK>) I believe this is an exception and moreover I believe that viewers have become so jaded to these attempts that they instinctively rebelled against the film (<BREAK>hence the low rating<BREAK>) without even giving it a chance<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> The script by Seth Grahame-Smith is witty and clever and engaging<BREAK>. And wonderfully demented<BREAK>. The cast is to die for<BREAK>. Eva Green and Johnny Depp are at the peak of their craft<BREAK>, delivering with a straight face bits of dialog that lesser actors would choke on<BREAK>. The supporting cast (<BREAK>almost all A-list with a young Chloë Grace Moretz<BREAK>) is rock solid<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> Overall a delightfully deranged yet still entertaining exercise in being silly -- which is exactly what Hollywood aims for in these odd exercises<BREAK>. <NEWLINE> The IMDb rating is much too low<BREAK>. Give it another chance<BREAK>.<BREAK>
